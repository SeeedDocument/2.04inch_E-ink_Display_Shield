Do you like Amazon Kindle’s E-paper screen? E-ink Display Shield, an E-paper &amp; shield which uses exactly the same techniques, provides you a smooth and clear reading experience for you. It has a super-low power consumption. It won’t consume power until next refreshing of its screen, which enables it to maintain a clear display even in the power-off state. Users can customize texts and position of the characters displayed .Due to the character chip inside, it knows of 175 countries’ language and their respective characters.

##    Pins usage on Arduino
---
![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/2.04inch_E-ink_Display_Shield/raw/master/img/E-ink_Pin.jpg)

Pins Used for E-ink Control:

**D3:** VPP, Power Supply for OTP Programming.

**D4:** GT_CS, GT20L16P1Y select input pin.

**D5:** Eink_D/C, E-ink Data/Command control pin.

**D6**: Eink_CS, E-ink select input pin.

**D7**: BUSY, E-ink Device Busy Signal,When Busy is High, the operation of the chip should not be interrupted, command should not be sent.

Pins Used for SPI Interface：
-  ** D10:** SPI chip select
-  **D11:** SPI MOSI pin
-  **D12**: SPI MISO pin
-  **D13**: SPI serial clock pin

##   Usage

Following is a test using E-ink to display Chineses and displaying Characters.

###   Hardware Installation

1. Connect E-ink Screen with the shield via the FPC connector

2. Connect Arduino with PC via USB cable

3. Stack the E-ink Display shield onto your Arduino board

When you finished the hardware connection, it should look like this.

###   Update E-Ink Library

1. Download the [SeeedEink Library.](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/2.04inch_E-ink_Display_Shield/raw/master/res/SeeedEink.zip)

2. Unzip/copy the including folder to the path: ..\arduino-1.0\libraries

The following program is written to test the function of displaying characters. This demo code can be used as a test program as well as reference for your further exploration of other functions of the board.

**Demo 1：Displaying characters**

1. Restart the Arduino IDE. Open “displayCharacter” example via the path: File --&gt; Examples --&gt; SeeedEink --&gt;displayCharacter.

2. Learn about the command. In “displayCharacter”, the function we use is described as follow.

- **Name:** displayChar(INT8U x,INT8U y,INT16U unicode_Char);
- **Function:** Display a char of which the starting point is located at (x, y), The parameter unicode_Char is the character machine code.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

3. Upload the code. There should come up several characters on the screen as shown below.
![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/2.04inch_E-ink_Display_Shield/raw/master/img/45.jpg)

4. If you do not want to change the display, you can remove the screen, the characters will still be displayed.

**Note**

1) X must be the value in the range of 0 -14, y must be the value in the range of 7-171; The screen area occupied by a character as shown below.
</dd></dl>

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/2.04inch_E-ink_Display_Shield/raw/master/img/Adder2.jpg)

2) If X is greater than 14 or y is less than 7 ,the character cannot display normally;

3) See the page 18 to 24 of the [GT20L16P1Y datasheet](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/2.04inch_E-ink_Display_Shield/raw/master/res/GT20L16P1Y_Datasheet.pdf) to find references for the unicode_Char; The characters include Latin、Hebrew、 Thai、Greek、 Kirill and Arabic. All the characters size is 8X16;

4) The unicode_Char between 0x0020 to 0x007E can directly input via the keyboard. Such as the display of the character 'G' ,the function can be displayChar(3,10,'S') or displayChar (3,10,0x0047);

5) Every E-ink can display up to 84 characters.
</dd></dl>

**Demo 2：Displaying Chinese**

1.Open the “displayChinese” example. 2. Learn about the command. In “displayChinese”, the function we use is described as follow.

- **Name:** displayChinese(INT8U x, INT8U y, INT16U unicode_Chinese);
- **Function:** Display a Chinese character of which the starting point is located at (x, y), The parameter unicode_Chinese is the Chinese machine code
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

**Note:**

1) X value must be between 0 to 14, y value must be between 15 to 171. The screen area occupied by a Chinese character is shown below. If X is greater than 14 or y is less than 15, it cannot display Chinese normally.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/2.04inch_E-ink_Display_Shield/raw/master/img/Adder1.jpg)

2)The unicode_Chinese of the Chinese can see [GB2312 (Simplified Chinese) character code table](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/2.04inch_E-ink_Display_Shield/raw/master/res/Character_code_table.pdf). Every Chinese character size is 16X16.

3) The E-ink can display up to 40 Chinese.

2.The screen can also display two-dimensional code, just add the function displayTwoDimensionalCode(INT8U x,INT8U y) into the demo code, the starting point of two-dimensional code is located at (x, y). The phone can scan two-dimensional code to enter our website.

###   Displaying two dimensional code

1. If you want to display other two dimensional code, just change the values of the array dimensionalData[].

These values can get by converting two-dimensional code to lattice data. My method of getting lattice data is a bit lame, yet you can click [here](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/2.04inch_E-ink_Display_Shield/raw/master/res/Concrete_steps.doc) to see it if you are interested.

2. X value must be between 7 to 14. Y value must be between 25 to 171.

3. Upload the code. There should come up several Chinese characters and a two-dimensional code on the screen as shown below.
